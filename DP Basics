DP dynamic programming - it is enhanced recurssion.

two methods 
1. top down approach
2. bottom up approach

When DP is used in questions?

1. you will have to choose the elements to include in the solutions or not. and if there is choice then there will be recurssion.
2. if in recurssion there is sub-problem overlapping then we can use DP. if there is o overlapping and we still want to use DP then we can but it won't be much benificial.
3. Optimal things will be asked. (maximum value, minimum value)
